 Option 1: Quiz
 Create a web app, desktop app, or mobile app that allows the user to take a quiz on a topic of their choice. The
 app should fetch questions and answers from an external API, such as Open Trivia Database. The app should
 also keep track of the userâ€™s score and display feedback at the end of the quiz. If there is time remaining,
 choose one of the following to take it further:
 a. (Backend) Allow the user to create their own quizzes and share them with others, or
 b. (Frontend) Add features such as timers, hints, and leaderboards to enhance the user experience.

 Added Features:
 Hints, Timer, Leaderboard

 I have found that for some reason certain browsers like Edge sometimes get stuck in pending when making the
 XMLHTTPRequests. However, I found that FireFox works nicely.

 As written the server will start here:
 http://localhost:8082/public/index.html

 All questions are gathered from Open Trivia Database
 The design of the quiz questions and responses was inspired by zyBooks
